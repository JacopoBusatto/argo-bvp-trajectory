Documentation Index
===================

This repository ships a small stack of preprocessing and numerical tools for Argo-IMU trajectory analysis. Use the pages below to navigate the current documentation.

- Preprocess overview: high-level goals, inputs/outputs, and how to run the pipeline  
  docs/PREPROCESS/OVERVIEW.md

- Preprocess reference: per-module responsibilities, runner entry points, and debug scripts  
  docs/PREPROCESS/REFERENCE.md

- Sampling and validity rules: formal parking-phase sampling assumptions and cycle validity criteria  
  docs/PREPROCESS/SAMPLING_VALIDITY.md

Notes
-----
- Raw AUX/TRAJ files and generated outputs are not committed to git.
- The BVP/integration pieces are intentionally minimal; see README for current scope and limitations.
